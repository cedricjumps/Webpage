				 am a senior at Graceland University. I am also a track athlete. Throughout this web page, I will demonstrate how my skills as a programmer continue to grow and develop over the course of the semester. I look forward to increasing my overall skill with the basic computer language of HTML. 
Right now, I would say my skills are pretty basic. I have been using various different tools to help me achieve my goals of becoming better at programing. I will also be documenting my updates on my blog over at Wordpress. My link will be below.
